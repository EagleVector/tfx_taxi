Estimators run `v1.Session`-style code which is more difficult to write correctly, and can behave unexpectedly, especially when combined with TF 2 code.

    "\n",
    "Working in an interactive notebook is a useful way to become familiar with the structure of a TFX pipeline.  It's also useful when doing development of your own pipelines as a lightweight development environment, but you should be aware that there are differences in the way interactive notebooks are orchestrated, and how they access metadata artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "In a production deployment of TFX, you will use an orchestrator such as Apache Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, or Apache Beam to orchestrate a pre-defined pipeline graph of TFX components.  In an interactive notebook, the notebook itself is the orchestrator, running each TFX component as you execute the notebook cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "In a production deployment of TFX, you will access metadata through the ML Metadata (MLMD) API.  MLMD stores metadata properties in a database such as MySQL or SQLite, and stores the metadata payloads in a persistent store such as on your filesystem.  In an interactive notebook, both properties and payloads are stored in an ephemeral SQLite database in the `/tmp` directory on the Jupyter notebook or Colab server."

    "### Evaluator\n",
    "The `Evaluator` component computes model performance metrics over the evaluation set. It uses the [TensorFlow Model Analysis](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis/get_started) library. The `Evaluator` can also optionally validate that a newly trained model is better than the previous model. This is useful in a production pipeline setting where you may automatically train and validate a model every day. In this notebook, we only train one model, so the `Evaluator` automatically will label the model as \"good\". \n",
    "\n",
    "`Evaluator` will take as input the data from `ExampleGen`, the trained model from `Trainer`, and slicing configuration. The slicing configuration allows you to slice your metrics on feature values (e.g. how does your model perform on taxi trips that start at 8am versus 8pm?). See an example of this configuration below:"
